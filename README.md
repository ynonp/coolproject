# Next.js/TypeScript: Starter Web App Code Sample

This TypeScript code sample demonstrates how to build web applications using Next.js following the App Router paradigm.

Visit the ["Next.js Web App Security: Developer Guides"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/guides/web-app/nextjs) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure Next.js applications by implementing user authentication with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Next.js Project

### Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Web Application

Execute this command to run your Next.js application in development:

```bash
